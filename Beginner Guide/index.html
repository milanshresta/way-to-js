        <h2>JavaScript Beginners Guide</h2>
        <p>This is for a absolute beginner and for students who wants to step specially in web development. Many of you
            off course heard about website or something bla bla .com. Yes everything you see over the browser such
            Chrome, Brave, Safari, Microsoft Edge are called websites. Some websites are based on information, some of
            are based in entertainment or some of them are specific web based application which perform certain task.
            <br>
            To learn JavaScript, you have to know a basics of or fundamentals knowledge of HTML and CSS also what this
            language perform. So, while you’re learning of web development you’ll go through writing HTML which is the
            core structure of the web.
            <br>
            Everything on the web is set on HTML including images, text, links, buttons, videos etc. And after adding
            the content then CSS use to style the content of inside HTML. For instance adding color, adjustment of
            content and overall layout, look and feel of the websites.
            <br>
            Moreover, talking about the verison that we’re usign now is HTML5 and CSS3. This both technologies come a
            long way. And people behind this technology are making it more and more advanced. There is main 2
            associations which are W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) and WHATWG(Web Hypertext Applications Technology
            Working Groud).
            <br>
            Sometimes we think this languages are small and easy but it’s not ease when it comes to do more advanced but
            as a beginner it’s simple and esay.
            <br>
            So, directly jumping into the Javascript is gonna be confusing for first time. But understanding HTML & CSS
            will help you how JS can be a game changer for you to take you skills on top.
            <br>
            Here’s a file extension of HTML & CSS. You probably familiar with .jpg, .ppt, .png. They are also a file but
            they are in image format and power point format. It’s because the instructions tell computer when user save
            this file as in dot dot dot (. . .) something. This is a file of image, photoshop or coding files. So
            similar with .html and .css denotes a file of HTML & CSS and it doesn’t require any software to practice. It
            can done in text editor but save it as mentioned file extension.
            <br>
            Here’s the example;
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
              &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
              &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
              &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>This is a starter file structure of HTML. Where
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tells browser document type and it’s HTML5 . And everything you write is inside these
            tag
            &lt;html&gt;

            &lt;/html&gt;. Frist one is open tag and second is closing tag and it has (/). So, this way you can start
            practicing with HTML and CSS.
